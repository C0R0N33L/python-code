Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.
Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

def digital_root(n):
    while n > 9:
        suma = 0
        while n:
            suma, n = suma + n % 10, n // 10
        n = suma
    return n
